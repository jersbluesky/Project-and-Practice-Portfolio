 * Program:
 *    Assignment 11, Output
 *    Brother Ridges, CS124
 * Author:
 *   Jeremy Johnson
 *Summary:
 *   This program puts items and values for a budget into columns and 
 *   lines using the iomanip library and associated commands. I certainly
 *   miss the days where living expense was $650.
 *
 *
 *   Estimated:  1.0 hrs
 *   Actual:     3.0 hrs
 *     There were a lot of difficult aspects of this assignment for me. I
 *     know that I could have sought help, but I felt like discovering
 *     my own way to complete the assignment led me to learn a lot more,
 *     in this case.
