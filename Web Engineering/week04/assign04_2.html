        <h3><u>About Us</u></h3>
        <h4>The Creation of the Kimball Collective</h4>
        <p> In 2022, a collection of professional composers, conductors, performers, and music educators with years of collective
            experience bringing crafting both music and the musician came together to form Kimball Creative Music Transcriptions. 
            Our goal is to form a conduit of communication between those in education and professional music production. By doing 
            this, we can not only provide the service of transcribing custom music, but create an industry standard that will enable
            musicians at every level to connect with the music they are bringing to the world.
