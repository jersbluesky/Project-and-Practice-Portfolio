    <section><h3>Higher Education FOCUSED on YOU!</h3>
        <br>      
        <p>At virtually all state and private universities across the country
            and around the world, the focus is on the business of the university:
            the professors, the prestige, or the stock-holder. Students are nothing
            more than a bottom line. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>From the President, to the CEO; professors, facilities, costs, housing,
           books, boards, internships, partnerships, transportation, meals, advising,
           grad planning, assignments, tests, technology, ground-keeping, libraries, 
           community engagement, and more--all are approached from the perspective of making
           sure that YOU, the center of our organization, will have the maximum possible
           opportunity for financial peace in the perfect career for you.
        </p>
