      <h2 style="text-align: center">A Short Biography </h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../jerbear1.jpg" alt="The dog's name is bear." width="200" height="200"></p>
      <p style="font-family: Arial;">
        I was born in Boise, Idaho, to Mom and Dad, and enjoyed the company of siblings. My dog's name was 
        Bear. He was a good dog, and my family is a good family. We all still keep in touch, except for 
        Bear, who is likely dead.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Arial;">
        I went on a mission to Venezuela, then had to leave Venezuela in secret, wound up in Chile. For
        further details, look for a book I probably will never write about it. It was a real adventure, 
        and I really should write a book. 
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-family: Arial;">
        After my mission, I completed a degree in Music Education, and became a band director. I got married
        to a pretty lady, and had cute children. I enjoy them all quite a bit.          
      </p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial;">
        Though I loved teaching music, I found myself rarely having time for my family. After prayer and 
        fasting, I made the difficult decision to change careers. I reached out to my Bishop, who mentioned 
        the BYU Pathways program. I initially didn't think I'd qualify, having gotten a degree already. It
        turns out, God really does want me in this new career, as there is an exception to that rule for online
        only students, so I started down the path. 
      </p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial;">
        Here I am, now, back in Boise. I taught in Oregon and Utah, and finally circled back to where I started.
        I work for a healthcare company called Primary Health Medical Group as an IT Technician, and I can't 
        wait to graduate and work my way towards upper-level tech jobs.
      </p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial;">
        That's who I am. Who are you?
